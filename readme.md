# Hello, there! 👋
### Welcome to my about page! 🎈
---

While I might not be '*famous*' at all, here's something about me: 
I started with Python around 2 years ago...? It's hard to tell. I never tried another language since then. 🗣️🐍
 
  
   
I'm coding only for fun. I do not make any money from coding. ❌💵
 
  
I'm from Poland and learning English all the time I'm online. 🗣️🗽
 
  
   
    
    
You can add me on discord: `natix1` (unless I changed my nickname and forgot to update this readme)
